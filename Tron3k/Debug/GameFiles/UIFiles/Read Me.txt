Number of menus   //This value exists only once.
Menu id		  //Says which menu it is for example main menu eller settings. After this row the button information begins.
x y		  //x and y for the center of the button
class id	  //Says which class the button needs to be.
number of textures //Only needed if the class id is 1
texture1	  //First texture and also the texture it shall begin with.
texture2	  //The second texture
textId		  //Class 4 only
UniqueKey	  //A value that says what will happen when its clicked on. If the button doesn't have any event then just leave it at -1
hoverKey	  //1 if it should change texture when hovered over and 0 if not. Only works for Button objects so put it at 0 for everything else.




Note:
If it has the class id 1 it can have more then two textures,
so put the amount of textures right under class id.
Jump over it if the class id isn't 1.
